# N-Queens

This is yet another program I wrote for an assignment while in college. It is a program meant to solve the "n queens problem", a more general version of the more famous "eight queens puzzle". What makes this program rather interesting is that it is non-recursive and utilizes stacks to solve the "n queens problem". As a consequence, it is by no means the most efficient solution to the problem as it is easily outperformed by the common recursive solution the bigger that n gets. As such, "Queens.java" has been limited to a maximum of n=12 to avoid a long wait time due to the inefficiency of the solution as well as the fact that the program also prints out all the boards that satisfy the problem for a given n. However, the code can easily be altered to increase the maximum and to stop the program from printing out the boards if so desired.
